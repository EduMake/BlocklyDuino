Provide static type language blocks and code generators for arduino programming.\r\n\r\nBlocklyDuino also support [Grove](http://www.seeedstudio.com/wiki/GROVE_System) blocks to easily get started with microcontroller-based experimentation and learning.\r\n\r\n### Demo\r\n\r\nBlocklyDuino is a web tool. You can give it a try at\r\n[Link](http://www.gasolin.idv.tw/public/blockly/demos/blocklyduino/index.html) to see the working BlocklyDuino.\r\n\r\n### Run locally on your web browser\r\n\r\nIf you want to install it locally. Get code from github and open blockly/demos/blocklyduino/index.html in your browser.\r\n\r\nThe preffered way is to put the BlocklyDuino/web folder into a web server and open the url like localhost/public/blockly/demos/blocklyduino/index.html for use.\r\n\r\n### Usage (3 Step)\r\n\r\n1. Open browser to BlocklyDuino, Drag and Drop blocks to make arduino program. \r\n2. Select 'Arduino' tab to copy source code to Arduino IDE\r\n3. press 'upload' button to burn the code into arduino\r\n\r\n### ChangeLog\r\n\r\nCheck changelog [here](https://github.com/gasolin/BlocklyDuino/blob/master/CHANGELOG.txt)\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nFred Lin (@gasolin) .\r\n\r\nThanks Neil Fraser, Q.Neutron from Blockly http://code.google.com/p/blockly/\r\nThanks Arduino and Seeeduino guys for Arduino and Grove blocks.\r\n\r\nThe project is also inspired by arduiblock https://github.com/taweili/ardublock and modkit http://www.modk.it/\r\n\r\n### License\r\n\r\nCopyright (C) 2012 Fred Lin gasolin+blockly@gmail.com\r\n\r\n * Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\r\n * you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\r\n * You may obtain a copy of the License at\r\n *\r\n *   http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0","google":""}
